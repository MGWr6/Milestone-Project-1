Our first milestone project assessed our current knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and directed us to create browser-based game. This particular game is a number guesser. It is very simple in functionality but I feel it provides a solid grasp on my current understanding of JavaScript. I would like to improve upon this game in the future by adding animations, incentives to continue playing, and subtle cues to hint how close the player is to guessing the correct number.


Pseudocode
  - Player must guess a number between a set minimum and maximum number
  - Player gets a certain amount of guesses
  - Notify player of guesses remaining
  - Notify the player of the correct answer if they lose
  - let player choose to play again
